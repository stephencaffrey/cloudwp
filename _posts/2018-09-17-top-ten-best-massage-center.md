A wonderful serenity has taken possession of my entire soul, like these sweet mornings of spring which I enjoy with my whole heart. I am alone, and feel the charm of existence in this spot, which was created for the bliss of souls like mine.

I am so happy, my dear friend, so absorbed in the exquisite sense of mere tranquil existence, that I neglect my talents. I should be incapable of drawing a single stroke at the present moment; and yet I feel that I never was a greater artist than now.

<h3>The meridian sun strikes the upper surface</h3>
When, while the lovely valley teems with vapor around me, and the meridian sun strikes the upper surface of the impenetrable foliage of my trees.

I throw myself down among the tall grass by the trickling stream as I lie close to the earth. A thousand unknown plants are noticed by me. And but a few stray gleams steal into the inner sanctuary.

When I hear the buzz of the little world among the stalks, and grow familiar with the countless indescribable forms of the insects and flies.

Then I feel the presence of the Almighty, who formed us in his own image, and the breath.Â I am so happy, my dear friend, so absorbed in the exquisite sense of mere tranquil existence, that I neglect my talents. I should be incapable of drawing a single stroke at the present moment; and yet I feel that I never was a greater artist than now.
